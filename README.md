Styrolite provides a programmable sandboxing tool for workloads.

Styrolite is used as the workload lifecycle manager in Edera Protect,
leveraging Linux kernel namespaces to provide lightweight sandboxes for
workloads to run in, and is designed to provide low-level primitives
suitable for implementing a CRI.

Styrolite is named after the [substance used in Star Trek][st] used to
provide physical redundancy for scenarios where a medical quarantine
field could fail.
